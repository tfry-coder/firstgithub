My name is Terry Fry and my background is in mortgage banking and options trading.
My goal is to disrupt the mortgage industry by breaking the traditional rules of financing which is controlled mainily financed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  Additionally, I would like to explore options trading and how to gain advantage utilizing machine learning and algo trading. 
I chose FinTech due to my finance background and all the potential disruption possiblities.
